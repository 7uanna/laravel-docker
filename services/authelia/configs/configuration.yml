# Default redirection URL
#
# If user tries to authenticate without any referer, Authelia
# does not know where to redirect the user to at the end of the
# authentication process.
# This parameter allows you to specify the default redirection
# URL Authelia will use in such a case.
#
# Note: this parameter is optional. If not provided, user won't
# be redirected upon successful authentication.

# Level of verbosity for logs: info, debug, trace

totp:
    # The issuer name displayed in the Authenticator application of your choice
    issuer: auth.yourdomain.tld
    # The period in seconds a one-time password is current for. Changing this will require all users to register
    # their TOTP applications again.
    # Warning: before changing period read the docs link below.

# AUTHENTICATION BACKENDS
# The authentication backend to use for verifying user passwords
# and retrieve information such as email address and groups users belong to.

authentication_backend:

    # File backend configuration.
    #
    # With this backend, the users database is stored in a file
    # which is updated when users reset their passwords.
    # Therefore, this backend is meant to be used in a dev environment
    # and not in production since it prevents Authelia to be scaled to
    # more than one instance. The options under 'password' have sane
    # defaults, and as it has security implications it is highly recommended
    # you leave the default values. Before considering changing these settings
    # please read the docs page below:
    # https://docs.authelia.com/configuration/authentication/file.html#password-hash-algorithm-tuning

# ACCESS CONTROL
# Access control is a list of rules defining the authorizations applied for one
