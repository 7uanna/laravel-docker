### Available tools

*Composer* - https://getcomposer.org/

> Composer helps you declare, manage and install dependencies of PHP projects.

*PHPUnit ‚Äì The PHP Testing Framework* - https://phpunit.de/

> PHPUnit is a programmer-oriented testing framework for PHP. It is an instance of the xUnit architecture for unit testing frameworks.

*prestissimo* - https://github.com/hirak/prestissimo

> composer parallel install plugin.

*PHP Coding Standards Fixer* - http://cs.sensiolabs.org/

> The PHP Coding Standards Fixer tool fixes most issues in your code when you want to follow the PHP coding standards
as defined in the PSR-1 and PSR-2 documents and many more.

*PHP CodeSniffer* - https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer

> PHP_CodeSniffer is a set of two PHP scripts; the main `phpcs` script that tokenizes PHP, JavaScript and CSS files to detect violations of a defined coding standard, and a second `phpcbf` script to automatically correct coding standard violations. PHP_CodeSniffer is an essential development tool that ensures your code remains clean and consistent.

## Getting Started

If this was your app, to start local development you would:

 - Running `docker-compose up` is all you need. It will:
 - Build custom local image enabled for development.
 - Start container from that image with ports `8800:80` and `8443:443` open (on localhost or docker-machine).
 - Mounts the pwd to the app dir in container.
 - If you need other services like databases, just add to compose file and they'll be added to the custom Docker network for this app on `up`.
 - If you need to add packages to Composer, npm, bower, etc. then stop docker-compose and run `docker-compose up --build` to ensure image is updated.
 - Be sure to use `docker-compose down` to cleanup after your done dev'ing.

## Assumptions

 - You have Docker and Docker-Compose installed (Docker for Mac, Docker for Windows, get.docker.com and manual Compose installed for Linux).
 - You want to use Docker for local development (i.e. never need to install php or npm on host) and have dev and prod Docker images be as close as possible.
 - You don't want to lose fidelity in your dev workflow. You want a easy environment setup, using local editors, debug/inspect, local code repo, while web server runs in a container.
 - You use `docker-compose` for local development only (docker-compose was never intended to be a production deployment tool anyway).
 - The `docker-compose.yml` is not meant for `docker stack deploy` in Docker Swarm, it's meant for happy local development.
